[[overview]]
== Overview

Some systems (mostly embedded systems) have limited memory resources, and as
a result, the total code footprint is bigger than the available memory.
The concept of arranging code in ‘code overlays’ is quite old but still valid
these days to resolve the code size issue. The following document specifies the
requirement and design of an overlay manager engine for RISC-V.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +



[[High-Level-Design]]
== High-Level Design

[[Block-Diagram]]
=== Block Diagram
The following figure describes a general firmware block diagram with the
RT-Engine:

.Generic Firmware Block Diagram
image::images\Generic-Firmware-Block-Diagram.png[id="Figure-{counter:image-number}"]

*Firmware* – this is the software being executed by the RISC-V core.
It may contain several firmware modules that interact with each other or with
different hardware components through firmware drivers. The firmware code can
reside/execute in different memories, e.g., ROM, RAM, FLASH, etc.

*FW Module* – Firmware module that responsible for a specific operation in the
program. One Firmware module may reside/execute in a different memory region
than other firmware modules.

*RT-Engine* – this is the module responsible for managing the run time code
load and execution. It is compiled and linked as all other firmware modules,
and as such, it may also reside/execute in different memories. Any existing
firmware module wishing to invoke a function defined as an overlay function will
indirectly use the RT-Engine to dynamically load the function
 (if not already loaded) and invoke (call) it

{nbsp} +

[[Overlay-functions]]
===	Overlay functions
When developing firmware code for systems with memory constraints, the engineers
will program the code to define which function is designated to be an overlay
function. All marked overlay functions are gathered into overlay groups with a
size range of 512B-4K each. An overlay group may contain one or more overlay
functions, and it is the responsibility of the toolchain to create the overlay
groups encapsulating overlay functions.

[[Overlay-group-structure]]
====	Overlay group structure
An overlay group size ranges from 512B – 4K and may contain several functions.
Since an overlay group's boundary is always 512B, the group will be padded with
the Overlay `Group ID` up to the upper 512B boundary.
The structure of an overlay group is:

.Overlay group structure
image::images\overlay-group-structure.png[id="Figure-{counter:image-number}"]

[[Overlay-function-call]]
===	Overlay function call
On regular operation, when a given function foo() performs a call to function
bar(), the toolchain generates a core-specific ‘jump’ instruction code and
resolving the jump ‘address’. In overlay design, if bar() function is defined
as an overlay function, the compiler can generate a ‘jump’ instruction, but the
linker will not be able to resolve the symbol’s address since the ‘jump’ is not
referring a fixed address in memory.

[[Implicit-RT-Engine-invocation]]
====	Implicit RT Engine invocation
Since the linker can’t resolve the actual address of the overlay function bar(),
and it does know the address of the RT Engine entry point, the compiler shall
plant a ‘jump’ instruction to the RT Engine entry point instead of a ‘jump’
to bar(). To distinguish which overlay function is to be loaded and invoked,
the linker will use an address token defining the bar() overlay function
instead of the actual bar() address. Sharing a token will allow the RT Engine
to prepare (load/invoke) the correct overlay group in memory along with the
bar() function offset within the overlay group.


.Overlay operation example
image::images\overlay-operation-example.png[id="Figure-{counter:image-number}"]

[[Implicit-RT-Engine-invocation-for-a-non-overlay-function]]
====	Implicit RT Engine invocation for a non-overlay function
When a function foo() is declared as an overlay function, and it is calling
a non-overlay function bar(), there is a chance that when returning from bar(),
foo() will already be evicted. That could be if additional overlay functions
were loaded due to calling bar() or in another scenario, an OS context switch
occurred, and overlay function calls were done from that context.
Returning to an “already evicted” caller means that all non-overlay function
calls that are made from within an overlay function must be done through the
RT Engine. The toolchain replace the call to bar() with a call to the RT Engine
and set the token value to point to bar() address.
When the RT Engine is invoked, it will check if the token is a real token or an
actual address; in this case, an actual address the RT Engine will directly jump
to that address. When bar() completes, it will return to RT Engine, which will
load foo() if not loaded, and return to it.

[[Address-Token]]
==== Address Token
An address token is an overlay function descriptor providing all the needed
information for the RT Engine to load and invoke an overlay function.
A regular address is always an even number. Therefore, to differentiate a token
address from a standard address, the least significant bit of the address token
shall be set to 1 (odd).

[[RT-Engine-Management-Tables]]
===	RT Engine Management Tables
The following management tables are required for the RT Engine operation:

[[Overlay-offset-table]]
====	Overlay offset table
This table is an array of overlay offsets prepared by the linker.
A table index represents an overlay group ID; a table entry holds a specific
overlay group's offset. For example, entry #1 defines the location offset of
overlay-group ID #1. The offset is relative to the beginning of all existing
overlays (Per overlay standard - “overlay area” ). There can be a case where
several Overlay Offset Tables exist, and each such table refers to a different
overlay heap location (Heap ID Table 1 – Overlay token). In run-time,
the RT Engine shall get the overlay group ID from the address token and
use it with this table to determine the overlay offset to be loaded.
The overlay offset granularity is expressed in 512B units.

[[Overlay-offset-table-structure]]
=====	Overlay offset table structure
An entry in the overlay offset table is defined as follows –

[[Overlay-offset-table-structure]]
.Overlay offset table structure
[cols="1,3,11", id="Table-{counter:table-counter}"]
|===

^|B15:0 ^|Group offset ^| Offset from the begging of the overlay section;
                             value expressed in 512B granularity
|===

Table size (number of entries) shall be equal to the number of overlay groups
plus one unused entry footnote:[Entry n does not represent an actual overlay;
it exists to calculate the size of overlay ID n-1.]; a single table entry
represents each overlay group.
The group offset value is accumulative, and the overlay group size is calculated
by subtracting the overlay offset of the x+1 entry with the overlay offset of x
entry.e.g., in the following table, overlay group ID 2 is in
offset 5632B (11 * 512B) from the beginning of the overlay section, and its
size is 1024B

2+^| :

^|n  |
|===


The ‘Overlay Group ID’ field of the Overlay Address Token is used to access
an entry in the table.

[[Overlay-multi-group-table]]
====	Overlay multi-group table
Any given function can be defined as a multi-group function meaning it will
reside in more than one overlay group. The toolchain prepares this table;
the table index defines the multi-group identifier; table entries are sub-lists
of address tokens specifying all multi-group overlay functions; each sub-list
defines the overlay groups of one function. In run-time, RT Engine shall use
the input address token to determine if the token describes a multi-group
token. If so, the overlay ID token field specifies the first index of the
sub list in the overlay mulit-group table; RT Engine will iterate through
the sub list and check if one of the address tokes in the sublist is already
loaded. If none of them are loaded, the first entry of the sub list is used to
specifies the default address token.

[[Overlay-multi-group-table-structure]]
=====	Overlay multi-group table structure
An entry in the overlay multi-group table is an Overlay Address Token
(see _link:#Overlay-token-structure[Tabel 1 - Overlay token structure]_)).
The table size depends on the number of multi-groups and the number of
occurrences per function. A zeroed Address Token separates each mutli-group
token list. e.g., if there is only one multi-group and that multi-group
function appears in 3 overlay groups, it will mean we’ll have a single
multi-group ID (ID 0).
That Overlay multi-group table shall contain 4 entries
(the last entry will be zero). In the following example, we see that there
are 4 multi-groups with the IDs – 0, 3, 8, 11, and each multi-group
contains 2, 4, 2, and 3 occurrences of each function, respectively.

                                    case none of the Address Tokens of a
                                    specific group is loaded]

^|   ^| 0

^|11 ^| Some Address Token
^|   ^| Some Address Token
^|   ^| Some Address Token
^|   ^| 0

|===

When RT-Engine received an Overlay Address token with the “Multi-group token”
field set, it will extract the ‘Overlay Group ID’ field of the
Overlay Address Token so it can access the sub-token list in the
Overlay Multi-group table.

[[Reserved-registers]]
===	Reserved registers
As described in
link:riscv-overlay-software-standard-draft.adoc[riscv-overlay-software-standard-draft.adoc]
the RT-Engine shall have 4 RV dedicated resisters solely to it.
It means the compiler won't use those registers on the register-allocation
stage. The following registers are being used RT-Engine:

.Reserved registers
[cols="3,12,2", id="Table-{counter:table-counter}"]
|===
^|*Register/ABI name*

^|x28 (t3) <|Holds the stack register for the RT-Engine	^|Yes
^|x4 (tp)	 <|Only on RTOS support: Holds RT-Engine
            dedicated stack-pointer, per task/thread	  ^|No

|===

NOTE: x4 is not reserved. Currently, X4 is not being used by the compilers
(GCC 10/LLVM 12). X4 holds the thread pointer on OS system. If compiler/RTOS
uses this register in the future, we will need to allocate a different register.

[[RT-Engine-Entry-Point-Address-register-x31]]
====	RT Engine Entry Point Address register (x31)
The RT-Engine sets this register during firmware initialization time.
It shall be set to the address of the RT-Engine entry point function.
There are two cases where the compiler uses this register: i) When it encounters
a call to an overlay function. ii) when it encounters a non-overlay function
call from within an overlay function.In both cases, the compiler shall replace
the call to overlay function with a ‘JR’ instruction where x31 is the jump
register (rs1). This register content is fixed, and therefore there is no need
to save/restore its value in case of context switch or interrupt handling.

[[RT-Engine-overlay-descriptor-token-x30]]
==== RT Engine overlay descriptor/token (x30)
This register is read by the RT-Engine when it is called for determining which
function is to be invoked. There are 2 cases where the toolchain sets this
register: i) When an overlay function is invoked, the compiler/linker needs to
set this register with the corresponding Overlay Address Token.
ii) When a non-overlay function is called from within an overlay function,
the compiler/linker needs to set this register to hold the non-overlay function
address. Setting this register shall be done before the added ‘jump’
(to RT-Engine entry point address) instruction.

[[RT-Engine-Stack-Frames-Pool-register-x29]]
==== RT Engine Stack Frames Pool register (x29)
RT-Engine uses a designated stack to keep track of nesting function calls.
This register holds the next available stack element, and each element holds
token, return address, and offset to the previous element. +

On compilation time, the user needs to define the stack max depth.

Example:

.Example of function deepest nesting
image::images\example-of-function-deepest-nesting.png[id="Figure-{counter:image-number}",align="center"]

If this is our deepest nesting calling in our application, we need to define
the stack frame pool deep = 4 (+null element, end-of-list). +

On RTOS based application, the user should take into consideration that this
pool is shared between all tasks/threads. Therefore on a RTOS based application,
the max nested calling depth that the user should take
need to bes: *[sum of max nested calling depth per task]*. +
That is the worst-case scenario.



[[RT-Engine-Stack-register-x28]]
==== RT Engine Stack register (x28)
This register holds the address of the RT-Engine designated stack of the
main process. Each entry holds an allocated element address from the
“Stack Frames Pool (x29)”. +

On RTOS based application, this register is saved on a context switch time
since each task/thread can have its own nesting function calling on the joint
pull list (x29)

[[RT-Engine-task-thread-dedicated-stack-pointer-x4]]
==== RT Engine task/thread dedicated stack-pointer (x4/tp)
This register is being used only on RTOS based application.
Since the RT-Engine is defined to be none-blocking
(as much as it can per
link:riscv-overlay-software-standard-draft.adoc[riscv-overlay-software-standard-draft]). +

The logic flow of the RT-Engine can diverge if a context switch happened
in the middle of its operation. Meaning we may not return to the PC we
left when the context switch occurs. Due to this fact, we need to save all
related registers to a stack. This stack is part of the Task/Thread stack,
and x4 is pointing to it.

<<<
[[RT-Engine]]
=== RT Engine
The overlay engine designed to work only on 32bit system; therefore, the primary
need is *rv32i*.
Other extensions, such as *b*, *Zce* can be used to improve the size and
performance of the engine itself.

[[High-level-flow]]
====	High-level flow

.RT-Engine High level flow
image::images\RT-Engine-High-level-flow.png[id="Figure-{counter:image-number}", align="center"]
<<<

[[Address-token-query]]
===== Address token query
The RT-Engine needs to understand what is required to do:
i) Call an overlay function or
ii) Call a non-overlay function.
This information is provided by reading the Address Token register.
If the function is an overlay function, bit0 is set, and the Address Token
register holds the overlay function descriptor. The RT-Engine then uses this
 token to load and/or call the designated overlay function.
If bit0 is cleared, the Address Token register holds a physical memory
address of a non-overlay function, and the engine shall directly call this
function (no need for other handlings).

[[Search-for-an-already-loaded-overlay-group]]
===== Search for an already loaded overlay group
When the Address Token register holds an overlay function descriptor/token,
we first need to check whether the said function is already loaded in memory
to avoid redundant load. The RT-Engine extract the Overlay Group ID field
(bits[1:16]) from the Address Token register and search for it in the internal
database for “loaded overlay groups”. +

In some cases, the search is done twice; the first one is when a new call
to an overlay function is performed, and the second search is done when
returning to RT-Engine, and the return destination is also an overlay function.

[[Eviction]]
=====	Eviction
When the required overlay group is not loaded in memory, and the overlay heap
is entirely occupied, the RT-Engine needs to decide which overlay heap entry
can be evicted and replaced with the new overlay group.
The eviction needs to consider which group is less “hot” than others and the
required heap size for the new entry. The eviction algorithm is
LRU (least recently used). +
The eviction decision may also accrue twice:
i) When a new overlay function is called,
ii) and after returning to the RT-Engine while the return destination is an
overlay function,which was already evicted
(can occur due to nested overlay function calls).

[[Load]]
=====	Load
The load operation is initiated by RT-Engine and is implemented by the hosting
application. The engine does not care how the load is performed; it can be done
from different sources, e.g., volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or
communication interface. The call to the load routine is blocking and does not
return until the load is completed.

[[Saving-the-callee-token-and-caller-return-address]]
=====	Saving the callee token and caller return address
When the overlay function resides in memory, the engine must save the callee
token and the caller return address before it is being invoked. When returning
from callee to the caller, we first return to the RT-Engine to load the caller
if it was evicted. Due to this paradigm, we need to save the caller's return
address, and it’s token, so the RT-Engine can load it if needed.

[[Interrupts]]
====	Interrupts
There are two reasons why Overlay ISR are not supported:

. The fact that interrupt latency will increase makes this feature negligible 
for small strict RT systems that use Overlays.

. On vector mode, it will make the design more complex. Each entry in the vector
will need to be redirected to a main-manage function. Which will call the
engine with a giving token that presenting the ISR we want to serve.
This overhead will suppress the benefits of a vector interrupts concept.

Besides those two reasons, there is no limitation on implementing overlay
as an ISR.

<<<
[[Toolchain]]
===	Toolchain

This section describes the high level design for the compiler, linker and
debugger required to support overlays.

[[Compiler]]
==== Compiler

The compiler support will be implemeted in Clang/LLVM.

===== Flags

The `-moverlay` flag enables overlay support in the compiler. Specifically,
this flag:

* Reserves the registers required by the RT-Engine.
* Enables the use of attributes `overlaycall` and `overlaydata`.

===== Relocations

In order to support linker token generation, custom relocations are needed
to represent the token version of symbol addresses. These are currently placed
in the custom extension space, as defined in the RISC-V psABI document, but
will require moving after standardization.

The new relocations are as follows:

[cols="1,5,8",options="header",]
|==========================================================================
| Enum | ELF Reloc Type        | Description
| 220  | R_RISCV_OVLTOK_HI20   | U-type (upper 20-bit) token value
| 221  | R_RISCV_OVLTOK_LO12_I | I-type (lower 12-bit) token value
| 222  | R_RISCV_OVLTOK32      | 32-bit overlay token value
| 223  | R_RISCV_OVLPLT_HI20   | U-type (upper 20-bit) overlay plt address
| 224  | R_RISCV_OVLPLT_LO12_I | I-type (lower 12-bit) overlay plt address
| 225  | R_RISCV_OVLPLT32      | 32-bit overlay plt entry address
|==========================================================================

===== Input sections

The compiler places overlay functions or data in their own sections so that they
are self-contained and the linker can sort and group them. An overlay function
or data with symbol `X` will be placed in section `.ovlinput.X`. There is no
need to distinguish between functions and data in the section name as they are
treated the same by the linker.

===== Calling overlay functions

Any call in which the caller or callee is an overlay function must be invoked
via the RT engine, which means that link:#direct-call:[direct] and
link:#indirect-call:[indirect] calls involving overlay functions require a
different call sequence to normal calls.

Calls between overlay and non-overlay functions must be compatible with the
underlying ABI. To ensure this compatibility:

* The RT-Engine is responsible for obeying the calling convention (e.g.
maintaining argument passing, return value and register saving requirements).
* The compiler must not apply optimizations that would break the calling
convention when moving between overlay and non-overlay functions.

[[direct-call]]
*Direct call*

For a call to an overlay function (i.e. callee has attribute `overlaycall`),
the compiler must load the callee token into `t5` and then jump and link to the
RT-Engine entry point via `t6`.

For example, for the following code:
```
int globalCount;

void __attribute__((overlaycall)) f1() {
  globalCount += 3;
}

int main() {
  f1();
  return 0;
}
```
`main` compiles and assembles to:
```
Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <main>:
   0:   1141                    addi    sp,sp,-16
   2:   c606                    sw      ra,12(sp)
   4:   00000f37                lui     t5,0x0
                        4: R_RISCV_OVLTOK_HI20     f1

[[indirect-call]]
*Indirect call*

For an indirect call to an overlay function (i.e. callee has attribute
`overlaycall`), the function pointer will contain the address of an entry in the
overlay procedure linkage table (`.ovlplt`). A call via this function pointer
will jump to the entry in the `.ovlplt` which will then load the overlay
function token into `t5` and jump and link to the RT-Engine entry point via
`t6`.

For example, for the following code:
```
int globalCount;

void __attribute__((overlaycall)) f2() {
  globalCount += 2;
}

void __attribute__((overlaycall)) (*fptr)();

void set_fptr() {
  fptr = f2;
}

int main() {
  fptr();
  return 0;
}
```
`main` and `set_fptr` compile and assemble to:
```

*Return*

No special handling is required by the compiler.

===== Overlay data

RO data can be marked as overlay with the `overlaydata` attribute, for example:
```
__attribute__((overlaydata)) const int foo;
```

Overlay data `foo` will be placed in `.ovlinput.foo`.

===== Constraints

* Static functions/data cannot be marked as `overlaycall`/`overlaydata` (this
does not include class-static symbols), doing so will produce a compiler error.

* The compiler will not inline overlay functions.

* The compiler will not generate tail calls to or from overlay functions.

* Overlay functions/data must be 4 byte aligned so that they can be addressed by
overlay address tokens. The compiler will ensure this alignment.

* Arithmetic cannot be done on overlay tokens, this will produce a compiler
error.

[[Linker]]
==== Linker

The linker support will be implemented in GNU binutils.

The presence of `.ovlinput.*` sections in the input object files will trigger
the linker to enable overlay support. The presence of an overlay symbol in
multiple groups will trigger multi-group support.

===== Grouping

There are three ways in which an overlay symbol may be assigned to groups.

1. Manually, by providing a CSV grouping file:
* `--grouping-file <filename>`.
2. By calling a grouping tool that populates a grouping file. Two flags control
this:
* `--grouping-tool <tool-cmd>` - command used to call the grouping tool.
* `--grouping-tool-args <arg1>;<arg2>;...;<argN>` - arguments to be passed to
the grouping tool. The required argument `--in-file <filename>` specifies the
CSV file in which the linker should pass a list of symbols that require grouping
to the grouping tool. The required argument `--out-file <filename>` specifies
the CSV in which the grouping tool will output its groupings.
3. Linker autogrouping - the linker will put any overlay symbol that has
not been assigned to a group into its own group.

Linker autogrouping is the default. Grouping file and grouping tool are optional
and using both is an error.

===== Tables

The linker will construct the overlay offset table and multi-group table (if
multi-groups are present).

===== Sections

The linker will populate the following output sections:

* `.ovlgrps` - contains each overlay group. Referred to as ``overlay area` in the
requirements document.
  * The first group contains the overlay offset table followed by the multi-group
  table (if multi-groups are present).
  * Each overlay function and data is copied to the group(s) to which it has been
  assigned.
  * Debug info is associated with whichever group an overlay symbol is placed
  first by the linker. Subsequent groups containing the same overlay symbol do
  not have debug info associated with them.

* `.ovlcache` - the overlay heap into which overlay groups are loaded at runtime
by the RT-Engine. Referred to as ``heap area'' in the requirements document.

* `.ovlplt` - contains the overlay PLT.

===== Tokens

For each overlay relocation, the linker will construct the required
link:#Address-Token[overlay token].

===== Groups

Any symbol referred to by an overlay relocation must be assigned to one or more
link:#Overlay-group-structure[groups]. Each group will be populated with the
input sections for the symbols assigned to that group. Each group will be padded
to the next overlay group page boundary.

Minimum group size / overlay group page boundary is defined by symbol
`OVERLAY_MIN_GROUP_SIZE`.

Maximum group size is defined by symbol `OVERLAY_MAX_GROUP_SIZE`.

===== Overlay Procedure Linkage Table (PLT)

The overlay PLT contains an entry for calling each overlay function called via a
function pointer. Since each entry contains three instructions, users should
consider the code size overhead associated with indirect overlay calls (as well
as the speed overhead from the indirection).

20400384:       000f8067                jr      t6
```

===== Relaxations

The linker is permitted to relax the materialization of overlay tokens, for
example:
```
lui     t5, 0
addi    t5, t5, 3
```
could be relaxed to:
```
addi    t5, zero, 3
```

[[Debugger]]
==== Debugger

The debugger support will be implemented in GDB, which will interface with a
a Python overlay manager framework that handles the implementation details of
a specific overlay scheme (e.g. decoding overlay data structures; identifying
overlay functions, storage area addresses and cache area addresses; unwinding
through the RT-Engine).

[[Debug-info]]
===== Debug info

Debug info is associated with exactly one occurence of an overlay function or
data in the storage area. Since for overlays the program counter will point to
cache addresses rather than storage addresses, the debugger needs to be able to
translate between storage and cache addresses.

[[Mapped-unmapped-overlays]]
===== Mapped/unmapped overlays

The debugger will keep a record of which overlays are currently mapped into the
cache area. This needs to be updated whenever the RT-Engine loads or evicts an
overlay. To do this, the debugger sets an internal Overlay Event Breakpoint
(OEBP) on the debugger sync point shown in the link:#Block-Diagram[RT-Engine
High level flow diagram]. When the OEBP is hit, the debugger updates its
overlay mappings by examining the RT-Engine state (this internal update is
transparent to the user).

<<<

[[Breakpoints]]
===== Breakpoints

For a breakpoint created on an overlay within the storage area, when the
debugger inserts the breakpoint, it will insert a breakpoint on each cache
address at which the overlay is currently mapped.

If a breakpoint is created on a location within the cache area, the location
will be converted to a storage area address. If the cache address does not
relate to a currently mapped overlay the debugger will give an error and no
breakpoint will be created.

When the debugger updates its record of currently mapped overlays, any
inserted breakpoints for overlays that are no longer mapped will be deleted and
new breakpoints are inserted for newly mapped overlays.

When a breakpoint is hit, the program counter will be at a cache address. This
address will be translated to the storage address with associated debug info so
that line table information can be looked up.

[[Awareness-for-overlays]]
===== Awareness for overlays

When debugging an application with overlays, the end-user is unlikely to be
interested in seeing the debug flow of the RT-Engine for calls and returns
through the RT-Engine. Therefore, the debugger provides the functionality to
skip the RT-Engine when stepping through application code. This functionality is
enabled with `set skip-ovlmgr 1`.

RT-Engine skipping will occur in the following scenarios:

1. When doing `step` on a call that goes through the RT-Engine, a breakpoint
will be set at the start of the callee and the debugger will continue.

2. When doing `step` or `next` on a return to the RT-Engine, a breakpoint will
be set on the RT-Engine's return address and the debugger will continue.

3. When doing `finish` on a function that returns to the RT-Engine, a breakpoint
will be set on the RT-Engine's return address and the debugger will continue.

RT-Engine skipping does not occur for `stepi` and `nexti`.

[[Backtracing]]
===== Backtracing

Backtracing through the RT-Engine requires a custom unwinder that understands
the RT-Engine stack and can determine the caller's return address and stack
pointer based from the current position within the RT-Engine. This unwinder is
provided by the Python overlay manager.

If the RT-Engine was called by an overlay function, the return address for the
RT-Engine will be a cache address (of a now possibly unmapped overlay) that
needs translating to a storage address.

As a minimum, it is expected that debugger will be able to show return address
and stack pointer for each frame. The extent to which other registers are shown
for frames above the RT-Engine depends on the unwinder implementation.
